Provides all {@link de.jstacs.sequenceScores.statisticalModels.trainable.TrainableStatisticalModel}s, which can
be learned from a single {@link de.jstacs.data.DataSet}. Often, parameter learning follows a learning principle
like maximum likelihood or maximum a-posteriori. Parameter learning typically is performed analytically like for the homogeneous and inhomogeneous
models in the {@link de.jstacs.sequenceScores.statisticalModels.trainable.discrete} sub-package.<br />

Notable exceptions are hidden Markov models ({@link de.jstacs.sequenceScores.statisticalModels.trainable.hmm}), which are learned by Baum-Welch or Viterbi training, 
and mixture models ({@link de.jstacs.sequenceScores.statisticalModels.trainable.mixture}), which are learned by expectation-maximization (EM) or
Gibbs sampling.<br />

After a {@link de.jstacs.sequenceScores.statisticalModels.trainable.TrainableStatisticalModel} has been trained, it can be used
to compute the likelihood of new sequences.<br />

Any combination of {@link de.jstacs.sequenceScores.statisticalModels.trainable.TrainableStatisticalModel}s can be used to build a
{@link de.jstacs.classifiers.trainSMBased.TrainSMBasedClassifier}, which can be used to classify new sequences and which can
be evaluated using a {@link de.jstacs.classifiers.assessment.ClassifierAssessment}.<br />

Provides all {@link de.jstacs.sequenceScores.statisticalModels.StatisticalModel}s, which can compute a proper (i.e., normalized) likelihood over the input space of sequences.<br />

{@link de.jstacs.sequenceScores.statisticalModels.StatisticalModel}s can be further differentiated into {@link de.jstacs.sequenceScores.statisticalModels.trainable.TrainableStatisticalModel}s,
which can be learned from a single input {@link de.jstacs.data.DataSet}, and {@link de.jstacs.sequenceScores.statisticalModels.differentiable.DifferentiableStatisticalModel}s,
which define a proper likelihood but can also compute gradients like {@link de.jstacs.sequenceScores.differentiable.DifferentiableSequenceScore}s.
These can be found in the sub-packages {@link de.jstacs.sequenceScores.statisticalModels.trainable} and {@link de.jstacs.sequenceScores.statisticalModels.differentiable}, respectively.

 * This interface defines a scoring function that assigns a score to each input sequence. Such score can, for instance, be

 * the maximum score for the input {@link Sequence}.
 * 
 * The most important sub-interfaces are the {@link de.jstacs.sequenceScores.statisticalModels.StatisticalModel} for {@link SequenceScore}s that define a proper, i.e., normalized, likelihood
 * over the input {@link Sequence}s, and {@link de.jstacs.sequenceScores.differentiable.DifferentiableSequenceScore} that can compute the derivation with respect to their parameters.

Provides the classes for {@link de.jstacs.classifier.AbstractScoreBasedClassifier}s that are based on {@link de.jstacs.scoringFunctions.SamplingScoringFunction}s and that sample parameters
using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. The abstract base class of all such classifiers is the {@link de.jstacs.classifier.scoringFunctionBased.sampling.SamplingScoreBasedClassifier}, while
the {@link de.jstacs.classifier.scoringFunctionBased.sampling.SamplingGenDisMixClassifier} provides an implementation for the unified generative-discriminative learning principle.

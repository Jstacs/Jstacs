Provides <code>ScoringFunction</code>s that can be used in a <code>ScoreClassifier</code>. 
Among the currently implemented <code>ScoringFunction</code>s are 
<ul>
<li>
the <code>BayesianNetworkScoringFunction</code>,
which provides structure learning for inhomogeneous Markov models, Bayesian trees, and permuted Markov models,</li>
<li> the <code>MixtureScoringFunction</code> for mixtures of <code>ScoringFunctions</code>, and </li>
<li> homogeneous <code>ScoringFunction</code>s.</li>
</ul>

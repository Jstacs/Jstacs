A detailed description of all tools is available in the AnnoTALE User Guide_.

**Predict and Intersect Targets** predicts the top 100 target sites of a set of TALEs in a set of input sequences, and determines the intersection of target sequences between subsets of the provided TALEs.

The input sequences to scan for target sites should typically be a set of promoters of a host plant, provided in FastA format.

The TALEs may be provided in any of the TALE sequence FastA files generated by the *TALE Prediction* or *TALE Analysis* tools, or by a custom FastA file containing the complete coding sequence of one or more TALEs. Hence, *Predict and intersect targets* may also be used for a quick first analysis of target sites of TALEs from sources other than the "TALE Annotation Suite". For in-depth analyses of individual TALEs, we recommend to use our TALgetter_ program.

Alternatively, you can choose to make predictions for all TALE classes as represented by a "Class builder". Such a class builder may be generated by the *TALE Class Builder* tool for a custom set of input TALEs, by the *Load and View TALE Classes* tool, or by the *TALE Class Assignment* tool.
If this option is chosen, predictions are made for every TALE in each of the TALE classes, while intersections are computed only between those TALEs in a common family.

If you experience problems using *Predict and Intersect Targets*, please contact_ us.

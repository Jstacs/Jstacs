A detailed description of all tools is available in the AnnoTALE User Guide_.

**TALE Analysis** analyzes TALE DNA input sequences for TALE structure, i.e., it extracts N-terminus, tandem repeats, and C-terminus sequences as DNA and AS sequences, and also provides RVD sequences representing the RVDs of the TALE tandem repeats.

The input of *TALE Analysis* is a FastA file containing the complete DNA sequences of TALE CDSs. These may be provided from a file or from the output of the *TALE Prediction* tool.

If you experience problems using *TALE Analysis*, please contact_ us.

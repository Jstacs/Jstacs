Running GeMoMa:
===============

GeMoMa is an abbreviation for "Gene Model Mapper" and implements a homology-based gene predictor that uses the conservation of the exon-intron pattern between different organisms.

There are 6 essential steps that are divided into 3 phases. However, if you do not have any RNAseq data you can skip the first phase.
This guide only provides a rough overview. If your are interested in individual parameters you can call:
java -jar GeMoMa-<version>.jar CLI <toolname>
which will provide description for all available parameters.

Keep in mind that homology-based gene prediction only allows to infer genes with known peers in at least one reference organism.
Hence, homology based gene prediction might miss genes with no known peer in the reference organism(s).
On the other hand, homology-based gene prediction allows for inferring genes that are not or rarely expressed in the RNAseq samples.

Preprocessing RNAseq data:
--------------------------
For this phase, you need RNAseq data and a reference sequence or assembly of your target organism.
This allows for inferring experimental verified introns and coverage.

1)	Run your favorite read mapper (e.g. TopHat, ...) on your RNAseq data
2)	Extract introns (and coverage) running: java –jar GeMoMa-<version>.jar CLI ERE ...

Prediction candidate transcripts:
---------------------------------
For this phase, you need at least one reference organism with reference sequence/assembly and annotation as well as a reference sequence/assembly for the target organism.
Keep in mind that the outcome of GeMoMa highly depends on the quality of the reference annotation.
It’s possible to run step 3 to 5 with multiple reference organisms.

3)	Extract CDS-parts (and proteins) of the reference organism running: java -jar GeMoMa-<version>.jar CLI Extractor...
4)	Find homologous parts in the target organism running: tblastn ...
5)	Find homologous candidate transcripts in the target organism running: GeMoMa-<version>.jar CLI GeMoMa ...
	Currently, we use p=10 and ct=0.4 instead of the default values.

Aggregate and filter predictions:
---------------------------------
For this phase, you need only the output of step 5.
Keep in mind that you can run the second phase for multiple reference organisms. The individual predictions can be combined in step 6.

6)	Aggregate predictions running: java -jar GeMoMa-<version>.jar CLI GAF ...

General speed-up:
=================

If you 
1) like to speed-up the computation,
2) have lots of compute cores and
3) have large data set (i.e., a large number of lines in the CDS-parts file),
you can split the job in several independent jobs. Splitting the job can be done using

java -cp GeMoMa-<version>.jar projects.FastaSplitter <CDS-parts> <numberOfSplits> "_"

This will result in several independent FastA files containing some CDS-parts. You can run steps 4 and 5 on these individual parts.
Finally, you have to concatenate the resulting predicted annotations, protein, ...

Genomewide vs. specific genes:
==============================

By default, GeMoMa tries to make predictions for all CDS of the reference organism in the target organism. Hence, we call this a genomewide approach. Additionally, Extractor and GeMoMa have an option to allow for using only a list of some reference CDS (cf. parameter selected). This approach allows to further speed up the predictions especially if one is interested only in a certain part of the annotation.

Galaxy integration:
===================

GeMoMa provides a command line interface s well as everything to be integrated in your local Galaxy instance. For creating the XML files that are needed to be integrated into Galaxy, just run: 

java -jar GeMoMa-<version>.jar --create

If you like to modify some VM arguments for the java calls made by Galaxy you can alter them for each subtool individually. If you like to allow GeMoMa to allocate at most 40GB of RAM, you have to run

java -jar GeMoMa-<version>.jar --create GeMoMa -Xmx40g

to create the corresponding XML integration for GeMoMa.

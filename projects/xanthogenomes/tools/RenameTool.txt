A detailed description of all tools is available in the AnnoTALE User Guide_.

**Rename TALEs in File** lets you replace preliminary TALE names as generated by the *TALE Prediction* tool with systematic names as proposed by the *TALE Class Assignment* tool.

As input, *Rename TALEs in File* accepts a TSV containing the original names in the first column and the new names in the second column, and a GFF or Genbank file using these names for ``mRNA`` or ``CDS`` annotations. Typically, the TSV will be the one generated by the *TALE Class Assignment* tool ("TALE names"), but other properly formatted TSV files will work as well. The GFF or Genbank files should normally be those generated by the *TALE Prediction* tool.

In a continous pipeline of *TALE Prediction* -> *TALE Class Assignment* -> *Rename TALEs in File*, the GFF, Genbank, and TSV files should play together seamlessly.

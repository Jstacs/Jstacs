**Chromatin pileup** takes as input a BAM file of mapped reads from an DNase-seq or ATAC-seq experiment, computes a coverage pileup of 5' ends of mapped reads, and ouputs a simple tab-separated file with columns chromosome, position, and pileup value (number of reads with a 5' end at this position).

**EpiTALE** predicts TALE target boxes using a novel model learned from quantitative data based on the RVD sequence of a TALE and optionally considers methylation state of the target box during prediction as DNA methylation affects the binding specificity of RVDs. 
Additionally, EpiTALE optionally annotates chromatin accessibility of predicted target sites using output of the **NormalizePileupOutput** tool and result of peak-calling of DNase-seq and ATAC-seq data to the predictions of **EpiTALE**.

As input, **EpiTALE** requires

1. a set of sequences that are scanned for putative TALE target boxes. These sequences could be promoters of genes but also complete genomic sequences (FastA format). 

2. For computing p-values, EpiTALE additional needs a background set of sequences, which is by default generated as a sub-sample of the original input data.

3. The prediction threshold may be defined either by means of a p-values or an approximate number of expected sites. The latter will also be converted to a p-value, internally, and the defined number of expected sites in not met exactly, in general.

4. TALEs are specified by a FastA file containing their RVD sequences, where individual RVDs are separated by dashes (-). This is the same format also output by the *TALE Analysis* tool of AnnoTALE_.

5. It can be specified if both strands or only one of the strands are scanned where, in the former case, a penalty may be assigned to predictions on the reverse strand. While this penalty may be reasonable when scanning promoters, it should usually be set to ``0`` in case of genome-wide predictions.

6. As optional input **EpiTALE** considers methylation during prediction, if bismark output is provided. With Bismark methylation extractor_ with  parameters ``–bedGraph –CX -p`` you can generate a coverage file, which contains the tab-separated columns: 
``chromosome, start_position, end_position, methylation_percentage, count_methylated, count_unmethylated`` (file.cov.gz). 
You can alternatively use the tool **Bed2Bismark**, which converts data in BedMethyl format to bismark format. 

7.
(i) The chromatin accessibility of the input sequences can optionally be provided in narrowPeak format. By mapping ATAC-seq or DNase-seq data to the corresponding genome and then performing peak calling, e.g. with JAMM_. In case of promoter sequences as input, you should run the tool **NarrowPeakConvertToPromoter** to convert the narrowPeak-File to promoter positions. 
(ii) Additionally, you can calculate a coverage pileup of 5' ends of mapped reads with **Chromatin pileup** and normalize it with **NormalizePileupOutput**. In case of promoter sequences as input, you should run the tool **PileupConvertToPromoter** to convert to promoter positions. 

8.
(i) In case of **genomic search** the parameter *calculate coverage area* should be ``surround target site`` and you can set the number of positions before target site with ``coverage before value`` (default: 300) and the positions after target site ``coverage after value`` (default: 200). 
(ii) In case of **promoter search** the parameter *calculate coverage area* may set to ``on complete sequence`` or ``surround target site``. The number of positions before and after binding site in peak profile can be set by ``Peak before value`` (default: 300) and ``Peak after value`` (default: 50).

In case of **genomic search** you can filter predictions of TALE target boxes by the presence of differentially expressed regions in a defined vicinity around a predicted target box. with the tool **DerTALE** of AnnoTALE suite_.

Provides <code>ScoringFunction</code>s that are equivalent to directed graphical models. The currently implemented
<code>BayesianNetworkScoringFunction</code> provides structure learning for inhomogeneous Markov models, Bayesian trees, and permuted Markov models,
but can be extended to other graph structures easily using the <code>Measure</code> interface. When using a <code>BayesianNetworkScoringFunction</code>
in the <code>CLLClassifier</code>, it is important to define only moral Bayesian network structures, because other in the chosen parameterization the 
normalization is not defined.

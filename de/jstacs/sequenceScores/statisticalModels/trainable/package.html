Provides the interface <code>TrainableStatisticalModel</code> and its abstract implementation <code>AbstractTrainSM</code>, which is the super class of all other models.
The <code>TrainableStatisticalModel</code> interface defines how to obtain a probability for a sequence and how to train the parameters of the model using a <code>DataSet</code>.
Any combination of <code>TrainableStatisticalModel</code>s can be used to build a <code>TrainSMBasedClassifier</code>, which can be evaluated in a <code>ClassifierAssessment</code>.

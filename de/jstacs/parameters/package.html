This package provides classes for parameters that establish a general convention for the description of parameters
as defined in the <code>Parameter</code>-interface. This convention includes that each parameter has
<ul>
	<li>a name that should be meaningful for a potential user,</li>
	<li>a comment that adds supplementary information additional to the name</li>
	<li>a data type that can be used to render the parameter in some interface
	and to validate possible inputs</li>
	<li>optionally a <code>ParameterValidator</code> that allows for a stricter validation, e.g. a specified range
	of allowed parameter values</li>
</ul>
The package also provides some predefined parameter types for primitive data types and <code>String</code>s in <code>SimpleParameter</code>, collections of 
possible parameter values in <code>CollectionParameter</code>, and input files in <code>FileParameter</code><br />
<br />
All of these <code>Parameter</code>-types can be combined to <code>ParameterSet</code>s that contain a
set of <code>Parameter</code>s. As <code>SimpleParameter</code>s can also have <code>ParameterSet</code>s
as values (the corresponding data type is <code>DataType.PARAMETERSET</code>) and these can also be used
inside <code>CollectionParameter</code>s, a tree of parameters can be built that allows to select between different
options in a collection and set the parameters that belong to the selected option, or to bundle sets of parameters
into subsets to allow for a clearer organization of parameters.
